## 160. Judge Pre-Trial Conference Checklist for criminal cases in the General Division

(1) For every criminal case in the General Division that is scheduled for a Judge Pre-Trial Conference, unless the Defence has indicated that the accused wishes to plead guilty or the Court otherwise directs, the Prosecution and the Defence must each file, at least 7 days before the date of the Judge Pre-Trial Conference, a Checklist (called the “Judge Pre-Trial Conference Checklist”) in Form 33 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions. 

(2) Where the accused is unrepresented, the Legal Registry of the Supreme Court will arrange, at least 4 weeks before the date of the Judge Pre-Trial Conference, for a copy of the Judge Pre-Trial Conference Checklist to be sent to, or collected by, the accused.
